# Javascript: My Documentation
 Documentation about my reading of the book "JavaScript O Guia Definitivo 6º edição".  
 The idea is make a resume and/or code my learning at each chapter. This will help me to remember what I learned, but it costs nothing make it public.  
 Sorry for my English, I'm learning :]
