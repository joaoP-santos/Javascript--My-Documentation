# Javascript: My Documentation
 Documentation about my reading of the book "JavaScript O Guia Definitivo 6º edição".  
 The idea is make a summary and/or code my learning at each chapter. This will help me to remember what I learned, but it costs nothing make it public.  
 **OBS:** Some starters chapters was skipped, because I've started to read the book with a little knowledge in JS. I've readed them, but not writed about.
 Sorry for my English, I'm learning :]
